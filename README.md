Project 1- Codecademy - Building Websites from Scratch

This project was part of Codecademy.com's Pro Intensive Course, Building Websites from Scratch.  This was the first project
that was submitted for review by a Codecademy Advisor.  

The parameters for the project were as follows:
In this project, you'll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project 
will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the Internet, Codecademy, and other resources when 
you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

At a high-level, this project will require the following:

A folder structure that makes sense for the project
An HTML file
A CSS file

The rest of the page's styling (font sizes, colors, etc.) is outlined in the design spec.
